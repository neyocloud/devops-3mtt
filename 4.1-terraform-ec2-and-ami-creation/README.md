Sure! Here's your improved Terraform EC2 deployment guide rewritten using **first-person pronouns**, making it more personal and instructional ‚Äî great for blog posts, tutorials, or documentation written from your perspective:

# üöÄ My Terraform EC2 Instance Deployment on AWS

In this project, I‚Äôll walk you through how I **create**, **verify**, and **destroy** an EC2 instance using **Terraform** on **AWS**. I use the AWS CLI and Terraform to automate the setup, and I clean everything up when I‚Äôm done to avoid extra charges.

---

## üß∞ What I Needed First

Before I started, I made sure I had the following:

* ‚úÖ An AWS account with the right permissions
* ‚úÖ AWS CLI installed and configured
* ‚úÖ Terraform installed on my machine

---

## üîÅ My Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ I Verified My AWS CLI Configuration

To confirm that the AWS CLI was set up correctly, I ran:

```bash
aws configure list
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ I Checked My AWS Identity

Just to be sure I was using the right account, I used:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ I Created My Project Directory

Then I created a folder for the project and moved into it:

```bash
mkdir terraform-ec2-ami && cd terraform-ec2-ami
```

---

## ‚úèÔ∏è I Wrote My Terraform Configuration

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ I Created the `main.tf` File

Inside the project folder, I added this configuration:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "my_ec2" {
  ami           = "ami-07d02ee1eeb0c996c" # Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (x86_64) in us-east-1
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "Terraform-EC2-Instance"
  }
}

resource "aws_ami_from_instance" "my_ec2_ami" {
  name               = "Terraform-AMI-from-EC2"
  source_instance_id = aws_instance.my_ec2.id
  description        = "AMI created from EC2 instance using Terraform"
  depends_on         = [aws_instance.my_ec2]
}
```

> üí° I used an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS AMI in `us-east-1`. You can replace it with a different one if needed.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running Terraform

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ I Initialized Terraform

```bash
terraform init
```

This downloaded the necessary provider plugins and prepared Terraform for deployment.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ I Validated the Configuration

```bash
terraform validate
```

This helped me confirm that my configuration syntax was correct.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ I Reviewed the Execution Plan

```bash
terraform plan
```

This command showed me exactly what Terraform was going to create.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ I Applied the Configuration

```bash
terraform apply
```

I typed `yes` when prompted, and Terraform created both the EC2 instance and the AMI.

‚úÖ My output looked like this:

```
Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

---

## üîç I Verified the Deployment

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ I Checked the AMI in AWS Console

I logged into the AWS Console, navigated to **EC2 > AMIs**, and confirmed that the AMI was created successfully.

---

## üßπ Cleaning Up

### üîü I Destroyed the Resources

Once I was done, I cleaned up everything by running:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

I confirmed with `yes` when prompted.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ I Verified Everything Was Deleted

After destruction, I saw this:

```
Destroy complete! Resources: 2 destroyed.
```

I double-checked in the AWS Console to make sure nothing was left behind.

---

## ‚úÖ What I Learned

With this setup, I was able to:

* Launch an EC2 instance using Terraform
* Create a custom AMI from that instance
* Use infrastructure as code to manage AWS resources
* Clean everything up afterward to avoid unexpected costs
